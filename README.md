This project is about making it easier for a user to convert CLAMCOIN into Steem through [ShapeShift.io ](ShapeShift.io) and [blocktrades.us](blocktrades.us/)

Currently the only way for a user to convert CLAM into STEEM/SP/SBD is to either get lucky on ShapeShift if STEEM trades are enabled or the user will have to first trade for an altcoin that is accepted on [blocktrades.us](blocktrades.us/)

The current accepted altcoins on [blocktrades.us](blocktrades.us/) is BCH, DOGE, DASH, LTC

This project helps the user decide which altcoin will give you the best return when using Shapeshift and Blocktrades.

- Technology Stack

Currently the ShapeShift API is being used to call the rate of 1 CLAM to ALTcoin and displaying it in an HTML table then that is being added as an iframe through a Javascript userscript with Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey/ViolentMonkey to be displayed under [blocktrades.us](blocktrades.us/)

- Roadmap

Perhaps [blocktrades.us](blocktrades.us/) would open their API one day so that a user could easier see which would be the best return on their conversion between CLAM and altcoins.

- How to contribute?

Anyone that can figure our Angularjs would be able to help with better integrating into [blocktrades.us](blocktrades.us/)
